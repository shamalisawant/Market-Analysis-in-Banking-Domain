# Market-Analysis-in-Banking-Domain
A Portuguese banking institution ran a marketing campaign to convince potential customers to invest in a term deposit scheme. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, the same customer was contacted more than once through phone, in order to assess if they would want to subscribe to the bank term deposit or not. This problem is addressed by conducting the market analysis of the data generated by this campaign.
